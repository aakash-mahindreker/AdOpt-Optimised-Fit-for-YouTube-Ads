# AdOpt-Optimised-Fit-for-YouTube-Ads

AdOpt is a YouTube Advertisement Optimizer which uses sentiment analysis, cohesion values and coherence values to generate the video links for a given advertisement category. The generated video links are the best spaces to post advertisements to reach the right audience. Advertisers can post text ads through comments of the generated video ids either manually or by developing a software. Alternative ways include posting video ads for non-premium users through third party applications like Google Ad Manager or Adsense.
